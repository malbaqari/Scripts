SUNBURST Detector
#############################

This is a simple powershell script to detect if your solarwinds host is present with hashes identified by FireEye for Sunburst Breach.

The script will post the path of the file if identified. If its present, you are highly suspicious to post-exploitation.

Download the sunburst-hashes.txt and sunburst-detector.ps1 to your solarwinds host and execute the script as administrator.
